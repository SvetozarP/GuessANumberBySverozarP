The project is represents a console version of the "Guess a number" game in Python.

The goal of the project is to create the game in Python, upload in GitHub and have a facility for online play.

For the game itself, code generates a number, assigned to a "computer's number" through the Random library with range 1 - 100.
The player then should input his guess. The code provides feedback, where the player's number is lower or higher than the computer one, if the number is not guessed.
Game is complete when the player guesses the computer's number.
